### Hi I'm Tomomi!ðŸ‘‹

I'm a visual designer in Brooklyn, NY. 
After a long search to discover my passion, I landed in the field of UX/UI, visual and web design. 
Here you will find some of my previous frontend work as I delved into html/css/js for a little while there when I realized I enjoyed coding too!
