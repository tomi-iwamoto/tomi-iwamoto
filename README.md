### Hi I'm Tomomi!  

I'm a UI/UX designer based in Brooklyn, NY. 
After a long search to discover my passion, I landed in the field of UI, visual and web design. 
Here you will find some of my previous frontend work as I delved into html/css/js for a little while there when I realized I enjoyed coding too!
I'm a perpetual problem solver and life long learner. 
Nice to meet you!ðŸ‘‹
